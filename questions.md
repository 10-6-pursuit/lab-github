```
The English mathematician and writer often regarded as the first computer programmer is Ada Lovelace. She worked with Charles Babbage on his proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, in the mid-19th century. Lovelace is credited with writing the first algorithm intended for implementation on a machine, making her the world's first computer programmer. Her notes on the Analytical Engine included an algorithm for calculating Bernoulli numbers, and her insights into the potential of computing went beyond Babbage's original vision, recognizing that the machine could be used for more than just number crunching.

Who is the "Turing machine" named after?

```

The "Turing machine" is named after Alan Turing, a British mathematician, logician, and computer scientist. Alan Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. He introduced the concept of the Turing machine in 1936 as a theoretical model of computation, providing a foundation for understanding the limits and capabilities of computing devices. The Turing machine played a crucial role in the development of theoretical computer science and the understanding of algorithmic computation.
